What makes magnets attract or repel each other?,"Magnets attract or repel each other due to a fundamental force of nature called the magnetic force. This force arises from the motion of electrons within atoms, which creates a magnetic field around each atom. When two magnets are brought near each other, their magnetic fields interact, causing the magnets to either attract or repel each other. The attraction or repulsion depends on the orientation of the magnets' magnetic fields relative to each other. If the magnetic fields are aligned, the magnets attract; if they are oppositely aligned, the magnets repel.","Magnets attract or repel each other due to a fundamental force of nature called the magnetic force.
